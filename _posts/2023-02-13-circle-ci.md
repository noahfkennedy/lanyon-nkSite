I spent a good portion of the last year freelancing at [Plainspoken Digital](https://www.plainspokendigital.com/), and although it was a thrilling experience, it left me without much time to keep the site updated.

2. Follow the set up instructions within the CircleCI interface for your GitHub-pages repo. I clicked the `Fast:` option and relied on my existing config. 
3. In
