Earlier this year in the peak of the pandemic it dawned on me that I hadn't really done anything creative in months, if not a full year. My life was mainly exercise and work, and while I had to leverage my problem solving skills, I never quite needed to be creative, to generate *something* from *nothing*, nothing but the neural connections deep in my brain.  <!--excerpt--> 

This was kind of a terrifying thought, a bit of an existential crisis, because it's not like I was walking around brain dead - I was listening to dozens of podcasts, practicing the piano, reading plenty of books, and [consuming content from LinkedIn thought leaders and Hacker News evangelists](https://durmonski.com/life-advice/following-people-online-is-dangerous/), but nothing net new was coming from my cerebellum. 

I spent a lot of time doing things I would describe as productive, and it led to a feeling that I was going somewhere, becoming the person I wanted to be (that latest [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html) essay I just read surely was going to help me become a CEO someday, right?). All that consumption created the illusion of progress.

So, as 2021 progressed, I started phasing out some consumption and started prioritizing more creation. In practice, this looked like me reading 50% fewer books and 80% less news, while trying to make sure that I was getting a few "creative reps" in every day. At the start, what counted as a rep literally did not matter. The goal was to get more practice flexing my creative muscles.

The epiphany reminded me of a lesson I learned in college. Around my sophomore year, I realized that reading the textbook was about a tenth as efficient as doing practice problems. There is no substitute for real world practice.  So, as 2021 progressed, I started building my website from scratch. I began improvising on the piano, rather than learning music that other people created. And at the start, I was absolutely terrible at both of these things. But week by week, I just persevered, and got a little better (note that I am still pretty darn awful at improvising, but my website finally doesn't suck).

I think there's a compelling argument for creating more and consuming less. What does 30 minutes a day of news get you? Maybe at that next happy hour you'll be a bit more informed, come across as a bit more well-read. But how about one whole month of spending those 30 minutes creating something? That's 15 hours to spend on a creative project, something that will leave you feeling more fulfilled and probably make you a lot more interesting at that next happy hour. You'll learn real skills that are highly additive to the rest of your life. 

I still read the news, and I still browse social media. But I'm trying to reframe it - this kind of consumption doesn't get me anywhere, and I'm trying to stop pretending that it's anything but entertainment. Recently, I read a [rather creative article](https://blog.tjcx.me/p/consume-less-create-more) that summarized a lot of what I had been feeling. I would absolutely recommend it.

Did I write? Yes
Did I run? Yes
Did I make music? For like 20 minutes, yes.
