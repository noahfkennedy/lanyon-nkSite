In one of my [earlier posts](2021/07/13/we-are-back) I wrote about [the skateboard analogy to MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp), and how important understanding this analogy was for me getting my site off the ground and actively creating. <!--excerpt-->

This has been a central theme in my life over the last few months. I've been prioritizing doing, whereas the last 23 years of my life I avoided action unless necessary (e.g. I was scared of failure or someone told me to). Instead, I thought about doing, I planned for what doing would look like, I prepared for a day of doing, but rarely actually did.  

The reason for all the avoidance and inaction is because doing is hard. Our brains crave the path of least resistance; we didn't evolve to expend extra energy on things not related to survival/reproduction. Watching YouTube videos on how to "do" gives all the endorphins of feeling like you're accomplishing something, without any of the effort! [John Mulaney sums it up perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CffwNZvILms) -

> It is so much easier not to do things, than to do them, that you would do anything is totally remarkable. Percentage wise, it is 100% easier not to do things than to do them. And *so much fun* not to do them, especially when you were supposed to do them!

Great! So we have step one of effective learning - action over inaction[^1]. This sounds pretty obvious, and I agree. The less obvious part is defining what counts as action. I think of action as anything forcing me to create/think.  Planning. The verb you use to describe it generally tends to give it away - Reading a textbook versus doing practice problems. Planning your essay versus writing an outline.

Step two is a bit more challenging. Once I understood that the only way to actually make progress was to stop pretending I was making progress, I had to start, somewhere. Where should I start? 

One of the challenges I've been bumping up against lately with learning and growth is not having a proper path forward. With making music, I have a lot of energy I just want to throw at learning, but it's not always well guided or effective. It's a problem I'm still working on, and one I'll think and write more about tomorrow.


[^1]: Here, I should probably remind you that just reading about action over inaction is just another form of inaction.
