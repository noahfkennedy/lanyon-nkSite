In one of my [earlier posts](2021/07/13/we-are-back) I wrote about [the skateboard analogy to MVP](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp), and how important understanding this analogy was for me getting my site off the ground and actively creating. <!--excerpt-->

This has been a central theme in my life over the last few months. I've been prioritizing doing, whereas the last 23 years of my life I avoided action unless necessary (e.g. my professors told me to). Instead, I thought about doing, I planned for what doing would look like, I prepared for a day of doing, but rarely actually did.  

The reason for all the avoidance and inaction is because doing is hard. Our brains crave the path of least resistance; we didn't evolve to expend extra energy on things not related to survival/reproduction. Watching YouTube videos on how to "do" gives all the endorphins of feeling like you're accomplishing something, without any of the effort! [John Mulaney sums it up perfectly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CffwNZvILms) -

> It is so much easier not to do things, than to do them, that you would do anything is totally remarkable. Percentage wise, it is 100% easier not to do things than to do them. And *so much fun* not to do them, especially when you were supposed to do them!

Great! So we have step one of effective learning - action over inaction[^1]. This sounds pretty obvious, and I'm not claiming that it's not. The reason I'm stating the obvious here is because pretend-action is a really easy trap to fall into. I think of action as anything that forces my brain to create/think. The verb you use to describe the action tends to give it away - Reading a textbook versus doing practice problems. Planning your essay versus writing an outline.

The example I hope anyone can relate to is this: Reading a textbook versus doing practice problems for school. For me, this made reality painfully obvious - I can't do well on an exam just by reading the textbook. Furthermore, reading a textbook is actually a grossly inefficient use of studying time. In college, if I had *only* done practice problems, I probably would've spent half the time studying. But I didn't, because practice problems are challenging, tiring, and make my brain hurt. 

The last part of that sentence is key - **practice problems make my brain hurt**. Pursue the activity that is most challenging, and that is where you will learn the most. That is the easiest way to distinguish between action and action[^2]. Deep down, we all probably know this, but internalizing it forces you to confront yourself when you take the easy route. 


[^1]: Here, I should probably remind you that just reading about action over inaction is just another form of inaction. 
[^2]: This idea was made popular in the book The War of Art, by Steven Pressfield. In this book, Pressfield states that we should actively seek out Resistance (similar to what I described above). Resistance is a sign that we are on the right path.

Did I write? No - this was delayed. My excuse is that I've been sick all week.
Did I run? Yes
Did I make music? Yes
