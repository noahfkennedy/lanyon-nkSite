          Step 1 of Effective Learning
        </a>
      </h2>

      <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2021</span>

      <p>In one of my <a href="2021/07/13/we-are-back">earlier posts</a> I wrote about <a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp">the skateboard analogy to MVP</a>, and how important understanding this analogy was for me getting my site off the ground and actively creating.</p>

<p>This has been a central theme in my life over the last few months. I’ve been prioritizing doing, whereas the last 23 years of my life I avoided action. Instead, I thought about doing, I planned for what doing would look like, I prepared for a day of doing, but never actually did.</p>

<p>The reason for all the avoidance and inaction is because doing is hard. Our brains crave the path of least resistance, we didn’t evolve to expend extra energy on things not related to survival/reproduction. Watching YouTube videos on how to “do” gives all the endorphins of feeling like you’re accomplishing something, without any of the effort! John Mulaney sums it up perfectly -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is so much easier not to do things, than to do them, that you would do anything is totally remarkable. Percentage wise, it is 100% easier not to do things than to do them. And <em>so much fun</em> not to do them, especially when you were supposed to do them!</p>

<p>Great! So we have step one of effective learning - action over inaction<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Step two is a bit more challenging. Once I understood that the only way to actually make progress was to stop pretending I was making progress, I had to start, somewhere. Where should I start?</p>

<p>One of the challenges I’ve been bumping up against lately with learning and growth is not having a proper path forward. With making music, I have a lot of energy I just want to throw at learning, but it’s not always well guided or effective. It’s a problem I’m still working on, and one I’ll think and write more about tomorrow.</p>
