title: About
---

Born and raised in DC/Arlington currently living in Manhattan. 

I graduated from the University of Delaware where I studied Chemical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Whoever said you can get a job with just a minor in CS[^1] was right - I've since pivoted to Data Engineering, working on a small project within Deloitte Consulting.

Here are some things I'm really interested in. It's a running list, and I'll probably write more about any subject on here. 

## Data Engineering

I look to the field of data engineering and see similarities to the internet boom that started in the 1990s - much like how access to the World Wide Web exploded, access to big data is exploding, through unparalleled access to compute and storage. In my eyes, data engineering is one of the big frontiers of technology and there's still a lot of ingenuity to come. We're seeing that now with companies like Snowflake and Databricks. 

## Biotech 

I'm trying to get back to my chemical engineering roots, I just don't always know how. Some more specific biotech areas I read about: 
* Immunology. 
* Biopharmaceutical Development.
* Gut microbiome.
* Computational biotech, stuff like [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery) or the work at [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/).

## Endurance Sports 

I do a lot of endurance sports, specifically triathlon. I've been taking advantage of the pandemic to see what a quasi-pro athlete life looks like, but sooner or later I'll "retire" and go back to riding my gravel bike and running long distances through the woods. 

If you're interested in custom training plans + one-on-one coaching, send me an [email](noah.kennedy1@gmail.com).

## Other Miscallaneous side projects

Trying my hand at a lot of other things:
* Making real good dairy free food to support my sweet tooth and lactose intolerance. 
* Zymurgy, mainly pretty bad Kombucha 
* Coffee making (My ideal moonlighting gig)
* Continuing to learn the piano
* "MVP Entrepreneurship", more specifically starting a sticker company with my brother
