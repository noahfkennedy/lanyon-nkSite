## About

Born and raised in the DMV, currently living in New York and working at [Tempus Labs](https://www.tempus.com/), and consulting on the side at [Plainspoken Digital](https://www.plainspokendigital.com/).

I graduated in 2019 from the University of Delaware where I studied Chemical Engineering with a minor (and then some) in Computer Science. During undergrad I realized I loved the day-to-day of coding much more than engineering, despite a strong passion for science. Luckily, the field of Precision Medicine exists, and I've been fortunate to marry the ideas of a chemical pipeline with a data pipeline, and carry out my work in a field surrounded by scientists. 

Here are some things I'm really interested in. It's a running list, and I'll probably write more about any subject on here. 

## Data Engineering

I look to the field of data engineering and see similarities to the internet boom that started in the 1990s - much like how access to the World Wide Web exploded, access to big data is exploding, through unparalleled access to compute and storage. In my eyes, data engineering is one of the big frontiers of technology and there's still a lot of ingenuity to come, most likely in the form of AI solutions that leverage that data. We're seeing that now with companies like Snowflake and Databricks, and AI shops such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta.

The largest areas for growth here are the democratization of data, which these warehouse companies are trying to get right, and tools for data quality, which seem to not yet exist at any real scale. 

## Biotech 

I'm trying to get back to my chemical engineering roots, I just don't always know how. Some more specific biotech areas I'm exploring more: 
* Immunology. 
* Biopharmaceutical Development.
* Gut microbiome - [Seed](https://seed.com/) is doing interesting work, and I'm actively considering an advanced degree in computational biology to study multiomics. 
* Computational research companies, stuff like [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery) or the work at [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/). I'm also eyeing work from [Creyeon Bio](https://creyonbio.com/) and [Atomwise](https://www.atomwise.com/). 


## Endurance Sports 

I do a lot of endurance sports, specifically triathlon. During COVID I briefly tried to become a professional athlete, but after placing 33rd at a pro qualifying race I've gone back to just trying to win the occasional local race and having fun. 

I have 8+ years coaching athletes, mainly friends and family, and I'm always interested in coaching more. If you're interested in custom training plans + one-on-one coaching, send me an [email](noah.kennedy1@gmail.com).

## Other Miscallaneous side projects

My current list of side projects. 
* Making real good dairy free food to support my sweet tooth and lactose intolerance. 
* Endurance Sports, primarily swimming at this time.
* Coffee making
* Making music on Logic Pro X
* Studying for the GRE and thinking of pros/cons for different advanced degrees.
