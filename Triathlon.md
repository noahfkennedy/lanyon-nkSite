title: Triathlon Coaching

I've been competing in endurance sports since a young age. No real pro aspirations but I like to pretend, sometimes.

If you're interested in highly efficient, personal training plans [send me an email](mailto:noah.kennedy1@gmail.com). Rates are negotiable, reasonable, and depend on what goals you're pursuing; my main reasons to coach are for fun and for practice, not to make money. Committed junior/student athletes rates are especially negotiable. 

## What you get: 
- Fully customized training plans updated weekly through TrainingPeaks. 
- Advice for race scheduling, planning, and executing. 
- Unlimited communication via text, email, TrainingPeaks. 
- Swim form analysis.

## Qualifications:  
- Past president of UD Triathlon, assisted in coaching and leading 50+ athletes. 
- 2 years coaching athletes of all ranges, from beginners to competitive age groupers. 
- 10 years of triathlon knowledge.
- Extensive experience competing, often at the national level, across a half dozen sports. 
&nbsp;

## Why you should get a coach (criteria and reasons):
- If you have tangible goals that you need help executing on.
- Writing your own training plans is time consuming. Having a plan for every day is convenient and efficient. 
- Self-coaching is hard. Even the best coaches will not have luck self coaching, because subjectivity leaks in. Results come from consistency. Consistency is easiest with objective training. 
- A good coach will teach you to be a better athlete, permanently.
